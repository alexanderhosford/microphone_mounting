THE ULTIMATE STEREO BAR PROJECT
===============================

• This project started off as a desire to make a Jecklin Disc baffle, something that I had been meaning to do for a long time. 
I realised that I also wouldn't mind replacing my existing stereo bars with something that offers more flexibility in terms of
stereo technique placement. Currently I use two of the K&M bars to do my placements, however this is something that does limit
my capabilities.
	
	• The K&M bars are small. This means if spaced omnis with anything over a 26cm distance are desired, two mic stands must
	be used. This wastes a mic stand, and introduces clutter to the workspace.

	• Setting microphone pairs that require a specific angle is taxing. A protractor must be used. These spacings would be
 	most useful, clearly marked out on the equipiment, other configurations be readily accessible. These marked spacings are 
	available on current bars, but these are at the higher end of the price scale.

	
• Central Mounting Piece

	• The entire system should be designed around a central mounting piece, that combines many features.

	• The piece must be fashioned from a single piece of material. Ease of construction and reproduction. Lower cost.

	• The piece should be designed so that it is capable of being 3D printed, without the need for further machining, for
	example drilling of holes or routing of channels.

	• The piece should offer both horizontal and vertical alignments. In a vertical position, the system will
	allow the setup of Blumlein pairs with ease.

	• The central piece should be designed, so that a baffle disc be allowed to slot on with ease and stability for the
	purposes of binaural techniques.

	• The central piece should be designed with recesses, so that standard, off-the-shelf thread adapters may be used,
	thus reducing cost and need for special component construction. Two standard ⅝ thread adapters will be required.

	• The central piece should possess a single thread recess, so that it may be securely fastened to the bar passing
	through it.


• Microphone Mounting Pieces

	• Microphone mounting pieces should also be 3D printed with the ability to adjust the thread from underneath.

	• A method should be devised, so that angular markers are available on each microphone mount (inverted to reflect left
	and right placement) so that traditional stereo mounting techniques may be honoured.



• Baffle Disc

	• The baffle disc is to be optionally attached to the central mounting piece.

	• 8mm ply (or acrylic) central disc, 330mm Ø
	
	• 2 x 3mm × 330mmØ cork discs

	• 2 x 1" × 330mmØ acoustic foam discs

	• 2 x 3D printed mounting pieces, capable of mounting flush with the central mounting piece.

	• (Optional) thick black curtain fabric, for covering the foam (mainly aesthetic, also would provide extra absorption)

	• If the option to extend functionality to a Schneider Disc is taken, then the following additional materials would 
	be required.

		• 2 x 6"Ø acoustic foam ⅓ spheres

		• Magnetic strips, to place underneath the curtain fabric to allow easy attachment/detachment of spherical pieces.

		• It must be checked that the inclusion of weak magnets will not have an effect on the electronics of the
		microphone capsules (x-post/r/acoustics/r/watmm)


• Main mounting bar.

	• 20mmØ

	• Square cross-section

	• Preferably chrome-plated

	• At least 500mm in length - need to check popular spacing options. 

	• For distance spacing options it may be necessary to get a longer bar, or design a modulqr system in relation to bar length.

	• Plastic cap-ends for tube, for aesthetic purposes and also safety regarding sharp edges.

	• A method will be necessary to mark out the distances of the microphone holders from the central piece.



• Additional Materials Required

	• Wing nuts, for the fastening in position of central mounting piece, microphone mounting pieces. These may have to be
	designed and constructed.
